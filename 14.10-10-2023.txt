typescript:

class:

*class always starts with capital letter
*new- used to create an object. whenever we use new the RAM will create a new space for object.
*inside a class cant use console.log, for that use method 


-----------------------------------------
example:-
*class Vehicle{}
create object:
let obj = new Vehicle("orange");

the orange is not an arguement , its an constructor.


------------------------------------------
Access modifiers:

public is accessible everywhere,
private is accessible only within the class,
protected is accessible by extending the parent class using extends keyword.
