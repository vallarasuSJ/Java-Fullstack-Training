------------------------

Topics:-
    *Data types 
        -Integer
        -Short
        -long 
        -double
        -character
        -float
        -boolean

    *operators  
        -,+,*,&&,||

    *array 
        -Array initialization
        -Array declaration

    *conditional statements
        -if else
        -nested If 
        -switch
        -else if

    *Iterations
        -for loop 
        -for each
        -while
        -do while

    *Types of methods
        -without argument
        -with argument
        -with return type 
        -without return type   

    *String , String builder, String buffer 
    *Math 
    *Try and catch 

Task:
---------------
    Built an console app for ATM application.
        -Balance
        -Deposit
        -withdrawal

Errors:
---------------

    * Array should stored in curly brackets not square brackets. 
         int a[]=[1,2,3]              //error occurs 

    * Array declaration the square bracket comes next to the data type.
        eg: 
         int arr[]=new int[5]; // error occurs 

    * Each data must be mentioned with that index.
        eg:
        int[] arr=new int[5]; 
        arr[0]=1;  

    *Error occurs if the array size is not mentioned.
        eg:
        int[] arr=new int[];   //array dimension is missing.
        

    * character declared in single quotes 
    * string in double quotes. String , s must be in capital. 

    

    * character array doesn't print when it prints with concatenation .
        eg:
        char arr[]={'a','b'}; 

        System.out.println("character " +  arr);  // error occurs 


    //condition statements  
        in switch case , || or operator cannot be applied instead | is used. 


    //looping

        *if continue used and its true in if condition in loop , the code next to the continue doesn't work.

        *break statement terminates the loop if the condition is true.

        * string  class is immutable 
        * string buffer and string builder is mutable , can be modified.
